## Config


Config Files and Scripts which I find useful and will try to improve over time

- Bash Aliases
- Gitconfig
- Provisioning script which is run the first time a system boots up after a clean install

TODO:
- Add a atom package list

## Installation
Download the raw provision.sh file and uncomment lines as needed. Run script when you are done.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeusername/config/master/provision.sh -O provision.sh
```

You can run the script directly with the following line, if you're happy with it as it is.


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeusername/config/master/provision.sh -O - | sh
```
(Do not run this if you don't know exactly what this is doing!)
