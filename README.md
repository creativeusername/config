## Config


Config Files and Scripts which I find useful and will try to improve over time

- Bash Aliases
- Gitconfig
- Guake Settings
- Provisioning script which is run the first time a system boots up after a clean install

TODO:
- Add a atom package list

## Installation
Don't run this if you don't know excatly what this is doing!

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeusername/config/master/provision.sh -O - | sudo sh`
